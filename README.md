# dresscode_detection_YOLO

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an automated system for detecting dress code (acceptable casual outfits) compliance using the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm. The primary goal is to ensure that individuals adhere to specific dress codes in environments where uniformity or safety standards are critical, such as schools, workplaces, or public venues.

## Main Features
### 1. Real-Time Monitoring
The system uses a webcam to monitor live video feeds, instantly evaluating individuals' clothing as they appear on screen. It uses a trained AI model, developed with a dress code dataset, to determine in real-time whether the detected attire is proper or improper.
### 2. Screen Capture
Automatically captures evidence of dress code violations for record-keeping or review purposes.
### 3. Sound Notification
Upon detecting a dress code violation, the system will immediately trigger a sound notification.
